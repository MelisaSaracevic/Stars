<p> Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most <br>
  fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of the <br>
  stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, <br>
  stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, <br>
  nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of <br>
  the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life, <br>
  and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy. </p>
