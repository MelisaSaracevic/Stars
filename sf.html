<h1> Star Formation  </h1>
<p> Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A <br>
 familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within <br>
 these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to <br>
 collapse under its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud collapses, the material at <br>
 the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the <br>
 collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. Three-dimensional computer models <br>
 of star formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break <br>
 up into two or three blobs; this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way <br>
 are paired or in groups of multiple stars.</p>

<p> The Violent End Stage of Star Formation </p> <br>
<p> As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. Not <br>
 all of this material ends up as part of a star — the remaining dust can become planets, <br>
 asteroids, or comets or may remain as dust. <br>
 <br>In some cases, the cloud may not collapse at a steady pace. In January 2004, an <br>
 amateur astronomer, James McNeil, discovered a small nebula that appeared <br>
 unexpectedly near the nebula Messier 78, in the constellation of Orion. When observers <br>
 around the world pointed their instruments at McNeil's Nebula, they found something <br>
 interesting — its brightness appears to vary. Observations with NASA's Chandra X-ray <br>
 Observatory provided a likely explanation: the interaction between the young star's <br>
 magnetic field and the surrounding gas causes episodic increases in brightness. </p> <br>
