<h1> Stars and Their Fates </h1>
<p> In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive stars live for billions of years. <br>
 When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core, nuclear reactions cease. Deprived of the energy production needed to support it, <br>
 the core begins to collapse into itself and becomes much hotter. Hydrogen is still available outside the core, so hydrogen fusion <br>
 continues in a shell surrounding the core. The increasingly hot core also pushes the outer layers of the star outward, causing them <br>
 If the star is sufficiently massive, the collapsing core may become hot enough to support more exotic nuclear reactions that consume <br>
 helium and produce a variety of heavier elements up to iron. However, such reactions offer only a temporary reprieve. Gradually, <br>
 the star's internal nuclear fires become increasingly unstable - sometimes burning furiously, other times dying down. These <br>
 variations cause the star to pulsate and throw off its outer layers, enshrouding itself in a cocoon of gas and dust. What <br>
 happens next depends on the size of the core. to expand and cool, transforming the star into a red giant.</p>

    <th> Average Stars Become White Dwarfs <br>
         For average stars like the Sun, the process of ejecting its outer layers continues until the stellar core is exposed. This dead, but still <br>
         ferociously hot stellar cinder is called a White Dwarf. White dwarfs, which are roughly the size of our Earth despite containing the mass <br>
        of a star, once puzzled astronomers - why didn't they collapse further? What force supported the mass of the core? Quantum mechanics provided <br>
        the explanation. Pressure from fast moving electrons keeps these stars from collapsing. The more massive the core, the denser the white dwarf <br>
        that is formed. Thus, the smaller a white dwarf is in diameter, the larger it is in mass! These paradoxical stars are very common - our own Sun <br>
       will be a white dwarf billions of years from now. White dwarfs are intrinsically very faint because they are so small and, lacking a source of <br>
       energy production, they fade into oblivion as they gradually cool down. This fate awaits only those stars with a mass up to about 1.4 times <br>
       the mass of our Sun. Above that mass, electron pressure cannot support the core against further collapse. Such stars suffer a different fate as <br>
       described below. </th>

    <td> White Dwarfs May Become Novae <br>
        If a white dwarf forms in a binary or multiple star system, it may experience a more eventful demise as a nova. Nova is Latin for "new" - novae <br>
        were once thought to be new stars. Today, we understand that they are in fact, very old stars - white dwarfs. If a white dwarf is close enough to a <br>
       companion star, its gravity may drag matter - mostly hydrogen - from the outer layers of that star onto itself, building up its surface layer. When enough <br>
       hydrogen has accumulated on the surface, a burst of nuclear fusion occurs, causing the white dwarf to brighten substantially and expel the remaining material. <br>
      Within a few days, the glow subsides and the cycle starts again. Sometimes, particularly massive white dwarfs (those near the 1.4 solar mass limit mentioned above) <br>
      may accrete so much mass in the manner that they collapse and explode completely, becoming what is known as a supernova. </td>

    <td>Supernovae Leave Behind Neutron Stars or Black Holes <br>
        Main sequence stars over eight solar masses are destined to die in a titanic explosion called a supernova. A supernova is not merely a bigger nova. <br>
        In a nova, only the star's surface explodes. In a supernova, the star's core collapses and then explodes. In massive stars, a complex series of nuclear <br>
       reactions leads to the production of iron in the core. Having achieved iron, the star has wrung all the energy it can out of nuclear fusion - fusion reactions <br>
      that form elements heavier than iron actually consume energy rather than produce it. The star no longer has any way to support its own mass, and the iron corev <br>
      collapses. In just a matter of seconds the core shrinks from roughly 5000 miles across to just a dozen, and the temperature spikes 100 billion degrees or more. The outer <br>
     layers of the star initially begin to collapse along with the core, but rebound with the enormous release of energy and are thrown violently outward. Supernovae release an <br>
     almost unimaginable amount of energy. For a period of days to weeks, a supernova may outshine an entire galaxy. Likewise, all the naturally occurring elements and a rich array <br>
     of subatomic particles are produced in these explosions. On average, a supernova explosion occurs about once every hundred years in the typical galaxy. About 25 to 50 supernovae <br>
    are discovered each year in other galaxies, but most are too far away to be seen without a telescope. </td>

    <td> Neutron Stars <br>
        If the collapsing stellar core at the center of a supernova contains between about 1.4 and 3 solar masses, the collapse continues until electrons and protons <br>
       combine to form neutrons, producing a neutron star. Neutron stars are incredibly dense - similar to the density of an atomic nucleus. Because it contains so much mass <br>
      packed into such a small volume, the gravitation at the surface of a neutron star is immense. Like the White Dwarf stars above, if a neutron star forms in a multiple star <br>
     system it can accrete gas by stripping it off any nearby companions. The Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer has captured telltale X-Ray emissions of gas swirling just a few miles <br>
    from the surface of a neutron star. Neutron stars also have powerful magnetic fields which can accelerate atomic particles around its magnetic poles producing powerful beams <br>
    of radiation. Those beams sweep around like massive searchlight beams as the star rotates. If such a beam is oriented so that it periodically points toward the Earth, we observe <br>
    it as regular pulses of radiation that occur whenever the magnetic pole sweeps past the line of sight. In this case, the neutron star is known as a pulsar. </td>

    <td> Black Holes <br>
       If the collapsed stellar core is larger than three solar masses, it collapses completely to form a black hole: an infinitely dense object whose gravity is so strong that nothing <br>
       can escape its immediate proximity, not even light. Since photons are what our instruments are designed to see, black holes can only be detected indirectly. Indirect observations <br>
      are possible because the gravitational field of a black hole is so powerful that any nearby material - often the outer layers of a companion star - is caught up and dragged in. As <br>
     matter spirals into a black hole, it forms a disk that is heated to enormous temperatures, emitting copious quantities of X-rays and Gamma-rays that indicate the presence of <br>
    the underlying hidden companion. </td>

    <td> From the Remains, New Stars Arise <br>
     The dust and debris left behind by novae and supernovae eventually blend with the surrounding interstellar gas and dust, enriching it with the heavy elements and chemical compounds produced <br>
    during stellar death. Eventually, those materials are recycled, providing the building blocks for a new generation of stars and accompanying planetary systems. </td>
